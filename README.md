# 🧱 Rebuilding My Portfolio – From the Ground Up!

Welcome to the repository for my **revamped personal portfolio website** — a clean, performant, and expressive space to showcase my journey and growth as a developer.

> “Building your own website is like coding your own story — and I want mine to speak loud and clear.”

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a complete rebuild of my original developer portfolio. The first version served as a learning sandbox when I began exploring React. Since then, I’ve expanded my skills across frontend and backend technologies, built real-world projects, and developed a deeper sense of design and performance.

This portfolio reflects:
- A clearer coding philosophy
- A love for simplicity and responsiveness
- A focus on delivering a memorable yet minimal user experience
